.. Note:: Tested on Debian 10, 11, 12, 13 and Linux Mint 20.2 but it should work on
	other Debian type OS's.

.. Note:: Requires Python 3.6 or newer to work.

Use the Debian deb for installing the Mesa Configuration Tool!!!

Download the `PC deb <https://github.com/jethornton/mesact/raw/master/mesact_1.2.0_amd64.deb>`_

Or use wget from a terminal
::

	wget https://github.com/jethornton/mesact/raw/master/mesact_1.2.0_amd64.deb

Raspberry `Pi 4 32 bit deb <https://github.com/jethornton/mesact/raw/master/mesact_1.2.0_armhf.deb>`_
Raspberry `Pi 4 64 bit deb <https://github.com/jethornton/mesact/raw/master/mesact_1.2.0_arm64.deb>`_

If you get `bash: wget: command not found` you can install it from a terminal with

Open the File Manager and right click on the file and open with Gdebi then install.

If the graphical version of gdebi has problems you can run it from a
terminal in the directory where you downloaded the deb with:
