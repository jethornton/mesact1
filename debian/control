Description: Mesa Configuration Tools for LinuxCNC
 Between the program controling the execution of a CNC mill, CNC lathe
 or a robot, and the powerful drivers that know how to turn a motor,
 is some glue-hardware required that can trigger the drivers to step
 or spin. 
 .
 It is not uncommon to see the parallel printer port being that trigger.
 For higher frequencies, and with the confidence of a perfect clock without
 the involvement of the computer's CPU, a small card may come to the assistance.
 This may be microcontroller, or as it is for the Mesa cards, an FPGA.
 .
 This software knows how to configure LinuxCNC for using one of the 
 5i25/6i25, 7i76e, 7i80, 7i92, 7i95, 7i96, 7i97 Mesa LinuxCNC motion control
 boards and daughter cards.
