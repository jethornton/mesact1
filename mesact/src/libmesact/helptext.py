Help Text for Axes Tab

Joints must be configured starting with 0 and not skipping any.

Any joint can have any axis letter.

Scale is the number of steps to move one user unit (inch or mm).
Limits are in user units.
Velocity is user units per second, Acceleration is user units per second per second

PID Settings
Default PID settings are driven by the Thread Period on the Options Tab.
If you change the Thread Period generate new PID values.
P = Proportional  P = (Commanded - Measured) * Pgain. 
I = Integral  I(new) = I(old) + Igain * (Commanded - Measured). 
D = Derivative  D = Dgain * (New_measured - Old_Measured)
FF0 = Commanded position * FF0 + Output
FF1 = First derivative of position * FF1
FF2 = Second derivative of position * FF2

FF0 is proportional to position (assuming an axis) or otherwise whatever
parameter is the input to the PID.

FF1 is the first derivative of position, so that is proportional
to velocity.

FF2 is second derivative of position, so it is proportional to acceleration.

Axis, PID Settings and StepGen Settings are required.

Homing fields are optional.

For gantry type of machines just select the same axis for each joint.

MIN_FERROR (Minimum Following Error) is the value in machine units by which the
joint is permitted to deviate from commanded position at very low speeds. If
MIN_FERROR is smaller than FERROR, the two produce a ramp of error trip points.
As speed increases the amount of following error also increases toward the FERROR value.

FERROR (Following Error) is the maximum allowable following error, in machine
units. If the difference between commanded and sensed position exceeds this
amount, the controller disables servo calculations, sets all the outputs to 0.0,
and disables the amplifiers. If MIN_FERROR is present in the .ini file,
velocity-proportional following errors are used. Here, the maximum allowable
following error is proportional to the speed, with FERROR applying to the rapid
rate set by [TRAJ]MAX_VELOCITY, and proportionally smaller following errors for
slower speeds. The maximum allowable following error will always be greater than
MIN_FERROR. This prevents small following errors for stationary axes from
inadvertently aborting motion. Small following errors will always be present due
to vibration, etc.

For a Gantry type machine the Home Sequence must be a negitive number.
Home Sequence starts with either 0 or 1 and you can't skip a number.
The first Joint for the gantry sets the Minimum Limit, Maximum Limit,
Maximum Velocity and Maximum Acceleration, however both joints need all fields
entered.

7i92 card requires the Master Branch of LinuxCNC

Mesa Ethernet Cards require LinuxCNC Uspace and the PREEMPT kernel.

Instructions to download and install Debian 9 and LinuxCNC Uspace with the
desktop of your choice

https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/
drill down to the latest version of the nonfree amd64 iso-cd netinst.iso

Burn to a CD if you have a PCI Ethernet card remove it, setup with the on board LAN only
Boot from the CD
Graphical Install, Do Not enter a Root Password! Just hit enter
Debian desktop environment, Mate, SSH server,Print server, standard system utilities

after booting to Debian 9 open a terminal
sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
to log in without your user name a password uncomment and add your user name
autologin-user=yourusername
autologin-user-timeout=0
CTRL X and yes to save and exit.

Open the Synaptic Package Manager
search for linux-image and install linux-image-latest.version-rt

reboot the pc

in a terminal
uname -a     # it should report back PREEMT RT
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get install dirmngr
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
*** to get the buildbot current build
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-key E0EE663E
sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://buildbot.linuxcnc.org/ stretch master-rtpreempt"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install linuxcnc-uspace

Configure the network adapter to work with an Ethernet card
To find the Ethernet adapter name
ip link show

sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
auto enp0s25 << change to match your interface name
  iface enp0s25 inet static
    address 10.10.10.1
    netmask 255.255.255.0

shutdown and install a second LAN card if you need to connect to the internet

for git and programming tools
sudo apt-get install git-core git-gui make gcc

to add open in terminal to caja
sudo apt-get install caja-open-terminal

to be able to edit the menu add mozo
sudo apt-get install mozo
