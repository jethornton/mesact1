<pcw--home> JT-Shop: all Ethernet cards should have the DPLL setup at least for the stepgen
<pcw--home> something like:setp [HMOT](CARD0).dpll.01.timer-us -50
<pcw--home> setp [HMOT](CARD0).stepgen.timer-number 1
<roycroft> the mesa experts are here now, so i'll leave further comments to them
<JT-Shop> thanks pcw--home 
<sensille> btw, what is dpll? i was wondering the other day. some clock sync between host and card?
<JT-Shop> pcw--home, is dpll dependent on the firmware having a d at the end?
<pcw--home> Yes, its basically as way to reduce sampling jitter
<pcw--home> All Ethernet firmware should have the DPLL (some ancient firmware does not but it should be upgraded)
<JT-Shop> ok thanks
<pcw--home> Ethernet latency can be in the 100s of usec which causes large position sampling errors (a similar large bogus corrections)
<pcw--home> The DPLL reduces the sampling error to about +-250 nsec
<pcw--home> That's expected if you only have one Ethernet interface
<pcw--home> The real time Ethernet interface cannot be shared
<sensille> good to know. so why the recommendation to move the fpga to a different IP net? or should it be connected back to back?
<pcw--home> On machines without slots, a USB Ethernet or WIFI  dongle is good for network access
<pcw--home> There are issues if the IP ranges overlap
<pcw--home> I would always use 10.10.10.10 (and a dedicated interface, so no switches)
<pcw--home> (you can use switches if you have multiple FPGA cards)


<JT-Cave> pcw--home, the 7i92T flashed with 7i77 or 7i76 firmware and I don't see any 7i77 or 7i76 pins, is it totally different now?
<pcw--home> It should be the same
<pcw--home> 7I92T jumpers are different from 7I92 jumpers though
<JT-Shop> ok
<JT-Shop> so the hal pins only show up when a daughter card is connected and powered up? I know the I/O needs power to be seen...
<pcw--home> Yes any sserial pins (with 7i76 or 7i77 on their name) need the daughterboard connected and powered to show up
<pcw--home> in their name
<JT-Shop> ok, I guess I never thought about that as I've always had the daughter card connected
<pcw--home> Yeah, that's the tradeoff with dynamic card discovery
<JT-Shop> what does setp hm2_[BOARD].0.stepgen.timer-number 1 do and is it needed for the 7i92T?
<pcw--home> It sets the stepgen DPLL timer number to 1 (this should be in all Ethernet configurations)
<pcw--home> (normally preceded by setp hm2_[BOARD].0.dpll.01.timer-us 50)
<pcw--home> sorry (normally preceded by setp hm2_[BOARD].0.dpll.01.timer-us -50)
<pcw--home> That sets dpll timer 1 to 50 usec before the nominal read time ( the minus on -50 means before )
<pcw--home> this means all stepgen position feedback registers are sampled at at least 50 usec before linuxcnc reads them
<pcw--home> This means if the host's Ethernet latency say adds 200 usec of delay occasionally it does not affect the feedback position
<pcw--home> because is always sampled at the same time regardless of when linuxCNC gets around to reading it
<pcw--home> (there are 4 DPLL timers and typically timer 1 is used for stepgens and quadrature encoders)
<pcw--home> though its arbitrary. You might need a second timer for absolute encoders to accommodate their serial read times
<pcw--home> and yet another for modules with write update timing
<JT-Shop> ok, thanks
<JT-Shop> and what do you use if it's a 7i77 daughter card?
<pcw--home> setp hm2_[BOARD].0.encoder.timer-number 1
<pcw--home> That's ok for any Ethernet card with an encoder
<pcw--home> (we actually any card with an encoder that has a DPLL but PCI cards for example don't always have a DPLL)
<JT-Shop> ok thanks
<pcw--home> welcome
